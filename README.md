# Super NeonSmashers

Game developed by iceldotme and jonobarel

In Super NeonSmashers, players take on the role of two jelly balls, fighting in a Neon Death Arena!

Jellyies are able to move, jump, defend, and of course -- shoot jelly pellets at their opponents.

## Goal
Defeat your opponent by shooting them in a best-of-three match.

## Gameplay

A single shot defeats an opponent. You can block using your bubble shield.
Pick up a Power Up orb for a bigger, faster shot!
**Powerups also penetrate defense shileds!**

## Victory
If you successfully shoot your opponent, or they fall off the edge of the arena - you win!
