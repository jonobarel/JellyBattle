Questions for Thursday Morning

Changelog?
 1. PalyerController.cs:
is there a reason you assigned palyerLight and playerParticles using `new Color(...)`?

2. PlayerController renamed to Player to be consistent with the object.


3. bullet behaviour is a bit erratic and unpredictable.

4. TODO: add visualization for shot recharge. Maybe "glow up" for internal light?
5. TODO: shield cooldown and interrupt shield animation on state Changelog
